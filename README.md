# Shiny modules: hands-on introduction 
Using the resources [here](https://github.com/garrettgman/webinars/tree/master/19-Understanding-modules)
to gain a deeper understanding of Shiny modules.

Reusing logic via modularity is something every major web framework already has 
in one way or another. For example, [Blueprints](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/blueprints/)
is the way to go if you decide to use Flask.


## Setup
 - Install RStudio
 - Install _shiny_ package

Note: file names that begin with "app_ex" are complete examples that
should be run independently of the main application.
